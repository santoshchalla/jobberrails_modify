== Description

Consistently reliable email address validations are difficult to find and hard
to choose as there are far too many implementations in various programming
languages.  This plugins builds on Thijs van der Vossen's validates_as_email
by adding advanced validation option support and also validating the length of
the email address.

== Usage

=== Example

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_as_email_address :email, :on => :create
  end
